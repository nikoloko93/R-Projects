# HRA_pilot_design

This repository contains the HRA pilot design grant codes. Two simulation codes was generated for this grant: Phase 1 and Phase 2 simulations. Phase 1 simulation encloses the process of generating the number of samples for the mini-pilot, while Phase 2 simulation encloses the process of generating the number of samples for the larger pilot. Sample calculations was based from the possible statistical test that will be used assuming greater than 80% power.
