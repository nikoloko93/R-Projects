### **SPE2 Sprint**
This sprint is focused on analyzing the impact of belonging to an asynchronous online support group on selected participants (SPE2 participants) on their diabetes management – as measured by their estimated glucose value (EGV), and on their physical activity level – as measured by their daily logged steps.

Analysis on their EGV and steps data is done in a two-fold approach: 
1. SPE2 participants vs. a comparison group, and 
2. SPE2 participants before and after the experiment period. 

To tie everything together, this sprint also analyzed survey results on SPE2 participants’ Fitbit group experience, which was done concurrently with the experiment via individual coaching call.

### **Contents**
* **scripts** contains all the raw scripts for the cleaning and preparation of data, comparison group selection, and the actual EGV and steps data analysis.
* **writeup** contains all the data generated from **scripts** needed in the R markdown file, which produces the HTML output.
